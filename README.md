# Zetkin
This is the new Zetkin front-end application, currently under development. It
will run at app.zetkin.org and replace the current www.zetk.in, call.zetk.in and
organize.zetk.in applications.

__NOTE__: This is extremely early stages of development. At the time that this
repository is published, it contains only boilerplate. The plan is to launch a
public beta in the spring of 2021.

## Technology
The new Zetkin app is built on [NEXT.js](https://nextjs.org) with TypeScript.
We develop and deploy using Docker.

## Development
Run the deveopment build using [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/).

```
